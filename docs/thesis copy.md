Introduction (+ subsection or not)
- general
- why fda is important
- why using MIPS in fda (and other fields)

Literautre review
- fda (only reference the zambon paper Z matrix)
- feature selection
- mip -> link to the 3rd chapter (for more details)
- (sparse fda)


Proposed methodology/approach
- Preliminary 
  - frM (general explaination) formulas and whatever
  - detailed basis expansion approach > z matrix
  - MIP - introduction ( even about the libraries used)
- (detailed)
- (algo implem)


Numerical Studies /Montecarlo
- methods 
- metrics
- all simulation settings (1 paragraph each)
- results for each setting

Application/Case study ( prob not)
- (fda datasets)

Final remarks (dal particolare al generale)
- # sum up 
- # limits
- # future developments ->
- # ideas of case studies and applications of this moedel (still a WIP)
- #
