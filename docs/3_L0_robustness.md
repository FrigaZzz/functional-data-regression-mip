### Step 1: Basis Expansion and Design Matrix Construction

- As described, the functional predictors \( x_{im}(t_m) \) are expanded using basis functions, leading to a linear model representation.
- The design matrix \( Z \) is constructed from the coefficients of the basis expansions and the cross-product matrices \( J_{\phi_m} \).
- Each row of \( Z \), denoted as \( Z_i \), corresponds to an observation and includes the transformed predictor information.

### Step 2: Computation of Robust Location and Scatter Estimates

- The coefficients from the basis expansion (constituting the rows of \( Z \)) are used to compute robust location and scatter estimates, typically using methods like Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD).

### Step 3: Calculation of Robust Distances

- Compute the robust distances for each observation based on the transformed predictors in \( Z \).
- The robust distance for each observation \( i \) can be calculated as \( RD_i = (Z_i - \tilde{l})^T \tilde{R}^{-1} (Z_i - \tilde{l}) \), where \( \tilde{l} \) and \( \tilde{R} \) are the robust location and scatter estimates, respectively.

### Step 4: Computation of Weights

- Finally, the weights \( w_i \) are computed as \( w_i = \min\left(1, \frac{p}{RD_i}\right) \), where \( p \) is a parameter (often the dimension of the predictor space).

### Mathematical Formulation for WLAD-agLASSO

Integrating these weights into the WLAD-agLASSO regression problem, we modify the objective function to include these weights:

\[
\min_{\gamma, \gamma_{\text{nonzero}}, \text{group}} 
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \left(Y_i - \sum_{m=1}^{M} Z_{im}^T b_m \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}\sum_{k=1}^{r} \gamma_{\text{nonzero},jk} + \lambda_{\text{group}} \sum_{j=1}^{p} \text{group}_j
\]

- Here, \( w_i \) are the weights computed as described above.
- \( Z_{im} \) corresponds to the transformed predictor information for the \( i \)-th observation.
- \( b_m \) are the coefficients for the basis expansions.
- The rest of the terms and constraints remain as per your original formulation.

This formulation integrates the robustness feature of WLAD-agLASSO into the functional regression framework by employing the weights derived from the robust distances of the transformed predictors. This approach aims to mitigate the influence of outliers in both the response and the functional predictors on the regression model.
