# functional-data-regression-mip
This repository presents an innovative approach to scalar-on-function linear regression analysis using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver. The method provided here addresses the challenges of functional data analysis (FDA), where the predictors are curves, images, or shapes that vary over a continuum such as time, space, or wavelength.
