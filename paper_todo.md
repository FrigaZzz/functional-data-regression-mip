ming yuan paperlibrary -> GRPLASSO LIBRARY ( just compare the L1 to the one )

- fix paper sim
- fix all the features except the error
- keep fixed the # of observations (starting)  
- change the number of inactive features (different betas)
- use only the l0_model
- use the l1_model to estimate the M bounds ( as average between the predicted coefficients values * 2 ) -> do some trials
- multiple settings
  -> activate / inactive features
  -> different errors 
  -> then different SNR as soon as it is implemented
  -> different number of observations are good
  -> measurements are not impactful -> fix it at 50
