NOTICE
- Remember to set the correct R lib path inside the script **root\setup\init_env.jl**

- **Usage_flow** explains how to navigate the JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS, the simulation process and the main functions and callbacks. 
- **results_sim** explains the outcomes of my tests and trials
- julia_code_runner.jl is an all-in-one simulation script that can be used to run tests instead of jupyter notebooks ( that can still be accessed to emulated the parameterizations)
